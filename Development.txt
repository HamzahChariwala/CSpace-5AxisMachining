SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

Introduce third spatial dimension 
Implement intuitive way to group/order checkpoints
Introduce roughing logic and combine with finishing C-Space
Select start angles by extracting some geometric information
Angle prioritisation based on proportion of points covered (greater speeds), and stiffness of machine/tool configuration
Merge tool png generation file with main to allow for greater parametric freedom
Group voxels to reduce computational expense, allowing for quicker runtime and greater resolution
Explore any other ways to improve resolution
EGO (or other) to select candidate angles to sample after initial run
Implement multi-tool sampling for each angle
Look into parallelising and/or optimisation for GPU operation
